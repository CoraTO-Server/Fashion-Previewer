# Why?

**Why not.**

I was using them for this anyway. You might need them.

## Dependencies

**Required pip installs:**

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

**Scripts that require Pillow:**
- `8bitbmp-to-palette.py`
- `convert_bmp_png_blk.py`
- `convert_bmp_png_mag.py`

**Scripts that only use built-in Python modules:**
- `delete_bmp_rename_folder.py`
- `reorder_palettes_light_to_dark.py`

That's it. Everything else is built into Python.
